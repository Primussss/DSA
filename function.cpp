/* people of this time does not understand the importance of time thry are wasting on screes specially those six inches 
bastards are the ones truely to the balme for the next generation kids being so dumb or so smart but yet none of them wants to read
a book now nor they like the exceptional cartoons and animes whoch airs on television now each of them have their own smartphone and 
they can search for alomst anyrhing they want no matter ehat kind of stuuf it is weather be porn or some of the most disturbing things
that could be found on the internet nowadays.i have thse concrns for those new age kida beacuse of my personal hooros that i experienced
with that phone thing when i was in my growth ages, there is this one video i truely wish i would had naver seen in y entire life and
yet that curios brain and eyes of that small kid were to see that stuff. it wad not truely a ghost or anyhting just some humans killing 
other humans but on a mass scale they did it with the help of a wire , a fast moving wire that sliced each of the members on that boat so 
so neatly that some of them didn't even knew they were killed theirs hands were still moving blood flowing out of peoples body like water 
that day was horrifying i shouldn't had watched that video back then but what is done cannot be changed now. that incident those visuals 
still have a deep scare on me and i want to forget it but i know i will not be able to forget it .
the conclusion that i drew that day from that experience of mine was that never touch a thing that says dangeorous for yourself no matter 
how tempting it is , and the same concern i have for the kids of this era they shouldnot allowed to have sm*/
